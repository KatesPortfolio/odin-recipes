    <h2>How to Make Vanilla Ice Cream</h2>
    <p>
      You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in
      the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ol>
        2 ¼ cups milk
      </ol>
      <ol>
        1 cup heavy whipping cream
      </ol>
      <ol>
        ¾ cup white sugar
      </ol>
      <ol>
        2 teaspoons vanilla extract
      </ol> 
    </div>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
        Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
        Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
